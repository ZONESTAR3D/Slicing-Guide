## Multi Color Slicing Examples with PrusaSlicer
- [Convert one 3d model to multi color and slice](#example-1-convert-3d-model-to-multi-color-and-slice)
- [Slice auto-mergeable multiple 3D model files](#example-2-combine-multiple-separate-3d-model-files-and-slice)
- [Combine multiple separate 3D model files and slice](#example-3-slice-auto-mergeable-multiple-3d-model-files)

### Some basic knowledge and operation
#### :bulb: About the use of the mouse (you need a mouse with a wheel)
1. Hold down the left mouse button and drag the mouse to rotate the model display area.
2. Hold down the mouse wheel and drag the mouse to drag the model display area.
3. Scroll the mouse wheel to zoom the model display area.

#### :bulb: It is recommended to set the color of the extruder according to the actually filament color you loaded into the extruder, which can help you understand the color of the actual printed objects. [:video_camera:Video](./pic2/color.gif)   

#### :bulb: Brief introduction of the painting menu.  [:art:picture](./pic2/paintingmenu.png)  
- **The function of color setting on the mouse button:**
  - click the ComboBox on the right of "First Color" and "Second Color" to select the color. 
  - The color of the brush corresponding to the left mouse button is the color set by First Color (that is, it is assigned to print with this extruder), 
  - The color of the brush corresponding to the right mouse button is the color set by Second Color. 
  - When you press the left and right mouse buttons at the same time, the brush is set to remove all smeared colors and restore to the original color of the model. 
  - You can also use the Back button in the upper menu to cancel the previous settings. [:art:picture](./pic2/backbutton.png)  
- **About the painting tools**     
  PrusaSlicer provides several color tools they are **Brush**, **Smart fill** and **bucket fill**.
  - **Brush**: Brush has three different shapes, sphere, circle and triangle. You can also set the size of different pen heads. Because 3D model files usually use multiple triangular shapes to describe the space shape, it is easier to find the boundary between model areas using triangular shapes. The use of sphere and circle will automatically separate the triangular shape on the model, and the use of others will be more flexible.
  - **Smart fill**: Smart fill can automatically identify continuous faces in space, which can quickly color areas with clear boundaries between the upper part of the model and other parts. By adjusting the value of the smart fill angle, you can make the area of one painting larger or smaller.
  - **Bucket fill**: Bucket fill can color the entire area, which is more suitable for use with Brush. When the boundary between the part to be colored on the model and other parts is not clear, you can use Brush to draw the boundary first, and then use bucket fill to color.

#### :bulb: The steps in these examples can be applied to M4 and E4 hot ends, but please note:
- Before slicing, select the machine and hot end model you use.  [:art:picture](./pic2/choosehotend.png)
- Before slicing, set the **Purging Volume** according to the type of hot end and the color of filaments. 
NOTE: this step is not necessary, but it is beneficial for the color resolution of print.
The specification for setting:
  - For E4 hot end, the range of value is 20 ~ 100 mm<sup>3</sup>; For M4 hot end, the range of value is 100 ~ 300 mm<sup>3</sup>
  - When switching from lighter color filament to darker filament, set to a larger value. When switching from darker filament to lighter color filament, use a smaller value.

### Example 1: Convert one 3d model to multi color and slice
**[:movie_camera:Video Turorial](https://youtu.be/fFSAb-FAl1k)**    
This example shows how to load one 3D model file, parinting color on this 3D model (assign different extruders) and slicing.    
#### Step 1. load 3d model file
:bulb:If the model file units is drawn in Inch, please uniformly convert to mm units when importing. [:art:picture](./pic2/unit.png)      
:bulb:If there is an error in the 3d model file, a triangle icon will be displayed. Click it to repair automatically. If it cannot be repaired successfully, you may encounter problems when slicing at the next steps. [:art:picture](./pic2/fix.png)     
#### Step 2. painting color on the 3d model
1. Open the painting menu. [:video_camera:Video](./pic2/painting1.gif)    
2. Painting color on the 3d model. [:video_camera:Video](./pic2/painting2.gif)
#### Step 3. Set slice parameters.
#### Step 4. Save the painted 3d model to a .3mf file 
This step is not necessary, but we recommend that you do so. So if you are not satisfied with the previous color after printing, you can directly import this 3mf and modify it.
#### Step 5. Slicing and save the gcode file.

### Example 2: Slice auto-mergeable multiple 3D model files
This example shows how to slice auto-mergeable multiple 3D model files which have set the same origin when drawing.

### Example 3: Combine multiple separate 3D model files and slice 
This example shows how to combine multiple 3D model files - which haven't set the same origin when drawing - toghter and slicing it.
